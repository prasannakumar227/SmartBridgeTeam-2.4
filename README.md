# Cyber Security and Ethical Hacking / Cyber Threat Intelligence (SIEM Analyst with IBM Qradar) Web Application and Penetration Testing

This paper discusses the vulnerabilities and risks associated with session management in network security, particularly session hijacking. The project aimed to explore the techniques and countermeasures related to session hijacking to raise awareness and promote better security practices.

## Key Takeaways

- Session hijacking refers to the unauthorized interception and control of an ongoing session between a client and a server, which can lead to various malicious activities such as unauthorized access, data theft, and impersonation.
- Different methods of session hijacking were examined, including packet sniffing, session cookie theft, and session fixation, and their effectiveness, impact, and potential countermeasures were analyzed.
- Secure session management practices are crucial in preventing session hijacking incidents, including implementing strong session identifiers, utilizing secure transport protocols (such as HTTPS), employing encryption techniques, and regularly updating and patching software and applications.
- User education and awareness play a crucial role in preventing session hijacking incidents, as individuals need to understand the risks and adopt appropriate security measures.
- The project was conducted solely for educational purposes, with the intention of understanding the techniques and countermeasures associated with session hijacking, adhering to legal and ethical guidelines, with no intention to engage in any malicious activities or harm any individuals or systems.
